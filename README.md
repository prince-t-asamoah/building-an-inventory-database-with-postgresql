# Building An Inventory Database with PostgreSQL

This project is database schema that could be used to organize an inventory of mechanical parts.  
It can be used to keep track of all the parts, their manufacturer, category, location in storeroom, available inventory, and other relevant information.

A database like this can be updated and queried by an inventory management application that accepts input from many users who might not be familiar with the database structure. To ensure sufficient data quality, a few constraint checks has being added to the queries in this project so that only valid data can be entered into the database.

Have fun!!
